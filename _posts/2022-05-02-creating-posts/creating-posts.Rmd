```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

In distill, blog posts must be knit intentionally and separately from the rest
of the webpage. In VS code this must be done using
 `rmarkdown::render("./path-to-file")`. The relative path of the file is accessible
 through right-clicking the file.

 To create a new post, use `distill::create_post("name")`

It will also be useful to set up my own template: https://www.ericekholm.com/posts/2021-04-02-personalizing-the-distill-template/
